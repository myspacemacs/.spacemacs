My Spacemacs file
===

Trying out [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) and trying to make it home. The defaults are pretty good but some customization is still required.

```bash
brew install emacs --HEAD --cocoa --srgb
brew install ag
npm i -g tern
git clone --recursive http://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
```

.. and put this .spacemacs file to your home.
